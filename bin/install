  # Between helm2 and helm3, they changed how to manage plugins and where they
  # get installed. So the easiest thing to do is just uninstall from both and
  # throw away any errors then try to reinstall.

  # If helm2/3 see that the plugin is already installed, it just fails, so
  # we'll uninstall and re-install. There's no way to overwrite in place

  # Uninstall helm2 plugin
  helm plugin remove secrets 2>&1 > /dev/null

  # Uninstall helm3 plugin
  helm plugin uninstall secrets 2>&1 > /dev/null
